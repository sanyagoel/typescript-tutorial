# TypeScript Learning Journey

This repo documents my daily progress as I learn and experiment with core TypeScript concepts — from the basics to more advanced features.

## 📅 Day 1 — Objects, Functions & Type Annotations

**Topics Covered:**
- Type annotations  
- Functions with typed parameters and return values  
- Objects and inline type definitions  

**Summary:**  
On the first day, I explored how TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript by explicitly defining variable types.  
I learned how to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values.  
I also understood how to create typed objects that enforce a specific structure, making the code more predictable and easier to maintain.

## 📅 Day 2 — Type Aliases, Interfaces & Type Narrowing

**Topics Covered:**
- Type aliases  
- Interfaces and interface merging  
- Union and intersection types  
- Type narrowing using `typeof` and `in`  
- Type predicates and user-defined type guards  

**Summary:**  
On the second day, I learned how to simplify and reuse type definitions using **type aliases**.  
I explored **interfaces**, how they define object contracts, and how they can be merged or reopened to extend functionality.  
I also studied **union types** for handling multiple possible variable types and how to use **type narrowing** to determine the actual type at runtime.  
Finally, I learned about **type predicates**, which help TypeScript understand specific object types based on custom logic.
